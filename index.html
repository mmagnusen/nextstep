        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I studied law at university, with bright ambitions of going into the profession when I graduated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon after graduating, it quickly became apparent it wasn't the right place for me
          so I packed up for the bright lights of London
        </p>

      <div id="marvel_chapter" class="font_colour">
        <h2>The Marvel Chapter</h2>
        <p>After a few stints working for different startups (Streetcar, which was aqcuired by Zipcar,
          RateSetter - one of the largest peer-to-peer lenders in the UK),
          and running my own business, I started working a Marvel. I spent about a year working in Support,
          doing everything from testing, sales, account management, data analysis and data visualisation.
          The great thing about working in a startup is that everything is new and unchartered,
          meaning you have the opportunity to dip your hand in everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          A large portion of my time was spent working alongside the dev team.
          It wasn't long before I went from reporting bugs, to poking around in our systems,
          then peaking under the hood and trying to learn about how things actually worked.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started off with Code Academy, learning the basics of HTML and CSS, moving onto Treehouse and using Youtube, Stack,
          Medium and anything else I could get my hands on. I found Codebar and still religiously attend.

        <h2>The Next Step</h2>
        <p>
          I'm currently enjoying getting stuck into my own personal projects.
          I find I learn best with a combination of 40% theory, 60% getting my hands dirty and building something.

        <h3>Hard Skills</h3>

        <div id="python" class="font_colour">
          <h4>Python</h4>
          <p>Core Python modules, including data types, reading and writing to files,
            regular expressions, classes and the Python debugger. I'm currently
            learning doctests and unit tests</p>
        </div>

        <div id="django" class="font_colour">
          <h4>Django </h4>
          <p>I started using Django as an admin end-user. As it's the Python
            framework I'm most familiar with, I'm currently using it to rebuild
            The Next Step Website. It's been a nice introduction to the
            MVC pattern and I'm enjoying learning more about the engine behind
            the admin I've been using.
        </div>

        <div id="salesforce" class="font_colour">
          <h4>Salesforce</h4>
          <p>Salesforce has been a huge learning curve. I've been impressed with
            the documentation built-up by the community and the endless resources.</p>
            <p>Experience with Salesforce Classic includes:</p>

            <p>Creating custom objects and tabs</p>
            <p>Workflow rules</p>
            <p>Custom fields, record types and page layouts</p>
            <p>Creating reports and dashboards</p>
            <p>Building Visualforce pages</p>
            <p>Field mapping</p>
            <p>Pushing data from third party services</p>

            <p>I'd love to get hands on experience with Salesforce Lightning and Apex</p>
